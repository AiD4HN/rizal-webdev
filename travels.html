          <div class="impact-content">
            <div class="impact-text">
              <p>Rizal's extensive travels across Europe and Asia profoundly shaped his worldview and provided him with a global perspective that was rare for Filipinos of his time. His exposure to liberal ideas, scientific advancements, and various cultures directly influenced his writings and reform advocacy.</p>
              
              <p>Through his journeys, Rizal was able to:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Gain first-hand experience of democratic societies and compare them with colonial Philippines</li>
                <li>Connect with fellow reformists and intellectuals who supported Philippine reform</li>
                <li>Access libraries and museums that provided him with knowledge unavailable in his homeland</li>
                <li>Develop advanced skills in medicine, languages, arts, and sciences</li>
                <li>Document Filipino culture and history from a perspective outside Spanish colonial influence</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>These experiences armed Rizal with the knowledge and perspective needed to articulate the aspirations of his countrymen and challenge the Spanish colonial narrative. His travels were not merely for personal enrichment but became a crucial element in his mission to seek justice and recognition for the Filipino people.</p>
