                    Jose Rizal was executed on December 30, 1896, an event that became a turning point in the Philippine revolution. In 1901, the Taft Commission officially declared him a National Hero. His death is commemorated every year on December 30.

                    <p>Jose Rizal’s execution on December 30, 1896 marked a turning point in Philippine history. His death sparked a full-scale revolution that eventually led to the country’s independence in 1898. In 1901, the American-led Taft Commission officially declared Rizal a National Hero. To honor his legacy, monuments were built in many towns, and December 30 was made a national holiday. In various provinces, groups of professionals formed the Caballeros de Rizal—now known as the Knights of Rizal—to preserve and promote his ideals.</p>

                    Jose Rizal was mourned in a way similar to Jesus Christ. In provinces like Laguna and Batangas, people even associated him with divinity. Because of the parallels between his life, mission, and sacrifice, he came to be known as the "Tagalog Christ."

                    <p>After Jose Rizal’s execution, many Filipinos began to view him in a spiritual light. In towns like Batangas and Laguna, people mourned him deeply, comparing his suffering to that of Jesus Christ. Some even believed Rizal watched over a paradise in Mt. Makiling. By 1907, he was called the “Tagalog Christ,” as groups known as Rizalistas began to form, believing he would return to save mankind. This belief echoed earlier figures like Apolinario de la Cruz and Felipe Salvador, who were also seen as messianic leaders by their followers.

                    Both Jesus Christ and Jose Rizal were reformers and martyrs who had devoted followers. They died young and unjustly, each sacrificing their life for a greater cause—Jesus for spiritual salvation, and Rizal for the political freedom of his people.

                    <p>Many Filipinos have drawn strong parallels between Jesus Christ and Jose Rizal. Both were Asians with brilliant minds and extraordinary talents, known for their compassion, healing, and reformist beliefs. Jesus sought to redeem humanity from sin, while Rizal aimed to free his people from oppression. They were nonviolent revolutionaries who inspired followers through words and actions rather than force. Tragically, both died at a young age and at the hands of those who opposed them, sealing their legacy as martyrs in the eyes of their believers.

                    <p>On September 24, 1903, the Philippine Independent Church canonized Jose Rizal as a saint, recognizing his martyrdom and influence on the Filipino people. This event marked the beginning of several religious movements that revered Rizal not only as a national hero but also as a divine figure. Sects such as the Colorum in Tayabas, Rizalina in Tarlac, the Banal in various towns of Leyte, and the Pantay-pantay Society in Legazpi began to form. These groups believed in Rizal’s spiritual power, reflecting his deep impact on both faith and nationalism.

                    <p>Several religious groups across the Philippines began venerating Jose Rizal as a divine figure. The Adarnista, founded in 1901, believes Rizal is the true god of the Filipino people and that he was never executed. Sambahang Rizal, established in 1918, treats Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo as sacred texts and performs Christian-like sacraments. Iglesia Watawat ng Lahi sees Rizal as Christ and God’s messenger, promoting love, heroism, and patriotism. Ciudad Mistica de Dios teaches that Rizal continued Christ’s mission, celebrating his life alongside twelve apostles in Mt. Banahaw.
