              <h3>Relationships</h3>
              <p>Throughout his life, Rizal had several romantic relationships that influenced his worldview and writings. His most famous relationship was with Josephine Bracken, an Irish woman whom he met during his exile in Dapitan. Though they were unable to marry due to his refusal to return to Catholicism, they lived as husband and wife.</p>
              
              <h3>Family</h3>
              <p>Born to a prosperous family, Rizal was the seventh of eleven children. His parents instilled in him a deep love for education and an appreciation for Filipino culture, despite the predominant Spanish influence. His family later suffered persecution due to his activism.</p>
              
              <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
              <p>Beyond his intellectual pursuits, Rizal enjoyed fencing, target shooting, and physical exercise. He was also known for his talent in creating sculptures and sketches. During his exile in Dapitan, he engaged in agricultural projects, established a school, and practiced medicine.</p>
